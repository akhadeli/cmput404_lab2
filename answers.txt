1:
    Using the socket() function, we can specify the type of socket. Setting this type to the constant
    SOCK_STREAM provided by the socket package creates a TCP socket.


2:
    A client socket initiates a connection to a server socket, allowing for requests and data to be 
    sent to the server. A server socket waits for incoming connections requested by client sockets.
    The server will take in requests and data from the client and handle it as required.


3:
    Using the SO_REUSEADDR constant from the socket library in the setsockopt() function permits the OS
    to reuse the same bind port.


4:
    We get the address info of the client, which is the IP address of the client, and the port number.


5:
    recv() returns data retrieved from the socket, in the form of a bytes object. This data is what has
    been sent by the client socket. After the client is done, the client sends an empty bytes object b''
    to indicate the closure of the connection.
